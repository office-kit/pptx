// Group / ungroup shapes (`<p:grpSp>`).
//
// PowerPoint's "Group" command wraps a selection's shapes in a `<p:grpSp>`
// whose transform maps a child coordinate space onto the slide. At
// creation time the child space is set 1:1 with the group's own slide-space
// bounds (`chOff == off`, `chExt == ext`) — see `group-builder.ts`. That
// convention is what makes `ungroupShapes` a pure structural move in the
// common case (no move/resize since grouping): children already carry
// slide-space coordinates, so no rescale is needed. If the group *was*
// subsequently moved or resized (its `off`/`ext` diverged from its
// `chOff`/`chExt`), ungrouping rescales each child's own transform so it
// keeps its on-slide position and size.

/**

 * slide-space bounds are the union of its members' bounds; the members
 * keep their own relative position/size (nothing is rescaled). The
 * target slide is taken from the first shape — every shape must belong
 * to the same slide.
 *
 * Every shape must:
 *   - belong to the same slide as the others,
 *   - be a direct child of the slide's shape tree (not already nested
 *     inside another group — ungroup first, then re-group),
 *   - have an explicit `<a:xfrm>` (placeholders that inherit position
 *     from the layout have none and can't be grouped),
 *   - appear at most once in `shapes` (grouping the same shape twice
 *     would duplicate its id).
 *
 * The group replaces its members at the position of the earliest one in
 * z-order, so grouping doesn't change how the selection stacks against
 * shapes that weren't part of it.
